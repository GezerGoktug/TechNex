# TechNex
**<p>In this project, I developed a technological product selling application with React and Firebase. You can look at the product you want in the application and review it. But if you want to add it to the cart, write a comment or add it to your favorite products, you must have a user account. When logging in, you can log in directly with the data you want or with platforms such as Google and Facebook. If you cannot find the product you are looking for, you can filter the products. I used Firebase Authentication for user authentication in my application. Firestore database was used to store other different user data and product data. Firebase Storage was used to store product images. Status management in cart transactions, filter and user authentication transactions Redux toolkit was used for the user. Toastify was used for a strong feedback experience to the user. Formik and yup libraries were used for the control, management and validation of form data during authentication. Framer motion was used for animation events. Additionally, the application was made mobile compatible.</p>**
